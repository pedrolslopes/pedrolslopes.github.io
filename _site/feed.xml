<p>In this edition of WoW, we explore the challenges and unique aspects of managing science in the public sector.</p>

<p class="notice--warning"><em>SPTS:</em> What would you say are the main challenges of scientific work in a public-sector non-academic space? How do you contrast it with academia or industry?</p>

<p class="notice--info"><em>SM:</em> In my experience, politics and public opinion significantly influence the scientist’s work—decisions on how to use results, whether to publish them, or even what to focus on. While similar dynamics exist in academia and industry, the public sector is particularly vulnerable to changes in government leadership. These shifts introduce additional layers of complexity that can take decision-making out of scientists’ hands.</p>

<p class="notice--warning"><em>SPTS:</em> What would you say is harder to fund in public-sector research: infrastructure or sustained operations/projects?</p>

<p class="notice--info"><em>SM:</em> This depends on definitions. We distinguish among infrastructure, capital, operational, and human resources:</p>
<ul class="notice--info">
  <li><em>Infrastructure:</em> Buildings and general assets not directly related to specific scientific equipment. These often have decent budgets, especially when safety or security improvements are needed.</li>
  <li><em>Capital expenditures:</em> High-value instruments or equipment. Funding for new instrumentation is particularly challenging.</li>
  <li><em>Operational budgets:</em> Consumables and tools needed to run equipment. These budgets are typically fixed and rarely increase, one of the reasons why new instruments are hard to fund.</li>
  <li><em>Human resources:</em> Team headcounts, which are significantly influenced by political factors.</li>
</ul>

<p class="notice--info">In my daily work, the hardest to fund (in order) are operational &gt; capital &gt; human resources &gt; infrastructure. However, circumstances can shift—for example, human resources can sometimes be particularly difficult to secure.</p>

<p class="notice--warning"><em>SPTS:</em> How do you view motivation? What keeps a scientific team motivated?</p>

<p class="notice--info"><em>SM:</em> Two main aspects come to mind—practical and professional.</p>
<ul class="notice--info">
  <li><em>Practical:</em> Flexible working hours are incredibly impactful, particularly for employees managing family responsibilities.</li>
  <li><em>Professional:</em> Helping employees feel proud of their work. This is especially important for specialists—for example, someone deeply knowledgeable about fish toxicology can become highly attached to their contributions. Respect and recognition go a long way in maintaining motivation.</li>
</ul>

<p class="notice--warning"><em>SPTS:</em> What pitfalls have you observed in your career that you’d advise junior scientific managers to avoid?</p>

<p class="notice--info"><em>SM:</em> The most important advice is to consistently self-reflect and understand your ambitions. The public sector has strict rules to ensure information is accessible to everyone, which can help employees navigate their career progression. However, climbing the ranks is often opportunistic, so timing is also critical. While this may not be a direct pitfall, being mindful of it is essential for long-term success.</p>

This course is often accompanied by a series of public lectures working as an outreach activity to engage the lay community.</p>

<p>In this public lecture series, reputed chefs are brought to a stage shared with a physics or chemistry Harvard instructor (at times known as a preceptor…Harvard culture has funny local jargon for reasonable widespread terms…), and the audience is stimulated to participate and engage in various ways. This year, in particular, the instructors of the course opened the opportunity for audience participants to share term papers and join in the course science fair with the students actually taking the full class.</p>

<p>Well, I am into cooking, and into science, and into challenges. So me, my wife and a friend (who all share some of these passions) decided to get together and pursue a small joint project. So for the first bona fide science post of Set Physics to Stun, I bring you the project we submitted to the class and science fair. The results were built on some good 10 hours of efforts in a kitchen and analyzing data on recipes for Brazilian pão de queijo.</p>

<h1 id="harvard-science--cooking-pão-de-queijo-and-the-tough-crust">Harvard Science &amp; Cooking: Pão de queijo and the tough crust</h1>

<p><em>Lisa Lin, Pedro Lopes, Marianne Moore</em></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In a cook-out get-together in October 2024, the present authors attempted a pão de queijo recipe from Alex Atala [1]. While the cheese puffs tasted fine, the texture of the crust did not correspond to the memories of one author who grew up in Brazil; the breads felt too dry, and the crusts too thick. Following the Harvard’s Science and Cooking public lecture series a few weeks later, we were led to consider the effects of heat (water) diffusion into (out of) pão de queijo, and what factors might govern its texture.</p>

<p>Though pão de queijo is naturally gluten-free and uses only tapioca starch, we found evidence suggesting that the varieties of tapioca starch used could be relevant. Most commonly mentioned were the effects of using sweet (unfermented) versus sour (fermented; polvilho azedo, henceforth referred to as azedo) tapioca starch, with the former contributing to denser crumb and the latter to a more open and elastic crumb [2][3]. In our original recipe, we used a mix of azedo (from Brazil) and sweet tapioca starch from Thailand (henceforth referred to as Thai starch), and some references also claimed a noticeable difference between sweet Thai tapioca starch and sweet tapioca starch produced in Brazil (polvilho doce, henceforth referred to as doce)[4]. Though this author attributed the result to the fineness of the milling, tapioca starch does not contain broken-down grains like regular flour, but rather just semi-crystalline granules of amylose and amylopectin that are typically extracted by filtering out any solids from the cassava root itself [5]. Despite having different textures, we believe that a more meaningful difference between Thai and Brazilian starches could be at play.</p>

<p>Rather than milling, we believe hydration plays a more significant role in the difference between Thai and Brazilian tapioca starches. In particular, the latter has a moisture content of around 45% [6], leading to its characteristic granularity in contrast to the fine texture of the former, which typically has a moisture content of around 13% [7]. One of the authors knows from experience that, upon further hydration, sifted Thai starch can be substituted for doce to good effect in recipes such as tapioca pancakes (beiju). Ref. [4] provides pictures comparing Brazilian cheese puffs made from Thai and azedo starches, but does not compare results using Thai and doce starches, leaving this hypothesis open to test. In wheat bread literature, the importance of starch gelatinization and retrogradation is well documented for different ingredients [8][9]. Given that the rise in bread is partially due to evaporation of water within the dough when exposed to heat, we expect that pão de queijo made from Brazilian tapioca starch, with its higher moisture content, will rise higher than pão made from Thai tapioca starch.</p>

<p>Pão de queijo has unquestionable popularity in its country of origin, Brazil, and this popularity is also growing internationally. Methodically applying a scientific empirical analysis on the controlling factors on the texture of this delicacy can help clarify and inform lovers of carby, cheesy goodness of how to tailor different aspects of any pão de queijo recipe to their own tastes. In this way we hope to advance the appreciation of this cultural heritage by diverse audiences worldwide.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>We investigate the effects of different ratios of sour to sweet tapioca starch on the thickness and texture of Brazilian cheese puff crusts. We also evaluate any potential discrepancies in the result by comparing Thai and Brazilian sweet tapioca flours.</p>

<h2 id="preliminaries-microscopy-imaging-of-starches">Preliminaries: Microscopy imaging of starches</h2>

<p>To give ourselves some intuition for how Thai and Brazilian tapioca starches would behave in a dough, we used bright-field microscopy to image the three starches we tested. The dry starch granules looked qualitatively identical at 10x magnification,, with perhaps lightly larger clumps in the doce starch (as could also be inferred by naked eye). On the other hand, mixing each starch with water in a ratio of 0.1 g starch : 200 ul tap water and imaging each sample on a glass slide covered with a cover slip revealed that the Thai brand starch granules absorbed water more uniformly than those of the Brazilian brands (1st image in right column, below), with kernels of undissolved starch still visible within the hydrated doce and azedo samples (2nd and 3rd images in right column, below). We thus expect doughs (and subsequent cheese breads) made from Thai starch to be smoother and softer than doughs made from Brazilian starch. In addition, granules of azedo flour tended to be least uniformly distributed throughout the liquid medium, leading us to expect the cheese breads made from azedo flour to be the driest and densest (as dense clumps would prevent the innermost starch granules from fully hydrating / gelatinizing).</p>

<h2 id="base-recipe">Base recipe</h2>
<p>From Alex Atala’s YouTube channel [1].
Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
  <li>180 ml milk or water</li>
  <li>50 ml oil</li>
  <li>10 g salt</li>
  <li>200g sour tapioca starch</li>
  <li>130 g sweet tapioca starch</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>300 g cheese</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="process">Process:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Mix the tapioca starches together in a bowl.
    <ul>
      <li>Note: despite salt being part of the ingredient list, Atala misses describing adding salt at any step of the recipe</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Combine the milk and oil in a small pot and bring to a rolling boil.</li>
  <li>Pour this hot liquid into the dry mixture from Step 1 to pre-gelatinize the starch (scalding), adding liquid slowly while mixing to ensure homogeneity of pre-cooked starch
    <ul>
      <li>Note: starches start to gelatinize at 60ºC [1], [9]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When the dough is cool enough to handle, add in the egg and cheese (avoid cooking either ingredient in too hot dough). Knead into dough to combine.</li>
  <li>Allow the dough to rest for 20-30 minutes. Shape into balls.</li>
  <li>Bake at 200ºC for 15-20 minutes on the middle rack of the oven or until golden brown. Rotate the pan by 180º halfway through baking to ensure even browning.
    <ul>
      <li>We sprayed the tray with water before closing the oven door to delay crust setting and hoping to maximize dough expansion</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Let cheese breads cool for 10 minutes before cutting.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="test-recipe">Test recipe</h2>
<p><em>Constants:</em>
We keep the quantities of milk, oil, salt, cheese, and egg constant. We use whole milk, canola oil, a mixture of cheeses (mozzarella, Gruyere, and cheddar), and large white eggs (about 50g each). Like Atala, we did not add table salt. We use previously unopened bags of starch from the following brands: Amafil (doce and azedo starches) and Three Elephants (Thai).</p>

<p>Our process was followed in a kitchen at 54% humidity, and 17ºC. We used the same kitchen scale for all measurements, which has an uncertainty of 1g, and the same ruler, assuming an uncertainty of 0.1 cm. We did not measure the temperature of the oven.
Changing parameters:
We change the ratios of sour vs normal cassava starch and compare Asian starch vs brazilian starch for the sweet starch:</p>

<h2 id="measurements-and-results">Measurements and Results</h2>
<p>At several steps of the process, we took different measurements on certain properties of the different doughs and analyzed them. The data we collected can be found in the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WpC536jd9pG34yVvRRj4WgwT3N5eg3G1h8FI9-6dRLs/edit?usp=sharing">Data spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<h3 id="testing-hydration">Testing hydration:</h3>
<p>Is Asian tapioca starch less hydrated than Brazilian starch or is the difference in texture of the powders just a result of milling?</p>

<p>By comparing weight and volume, we can estimate differences in water content for each starch. We took 5 measurements of leveled (and uncompacted) 1 tablespoon of each type of starch and averaged them.</p>

<p>Comparing the ratios of these average weights, we conclude that the Brazilian doce (sweet) starch is about 24% denser than the Thai starch. Though the Asian starch is finer in texture, the Brazilian one has more weight per volume, as one would expect for a higher water content in Brazilian doce flour. Assuming no difference in the original cassava species, we believe this indicates that the Brazilian sweet starch we chose is 24% more hydrated than the Asian one. This measurement corroborates our understanding that Brazilian tapioca starch is partially gelatinized and has a moisture content roughly 32% higher than Thai tapioca starch [8][9].</p>

<p>Note also that the density of the azedo (fermented) and doce Brazilian starches are the same. Assuming that the processing steps of these two starches are identical aside from additional fermentation of the azedo flour [10], then chemical changes from fermentation largely contribute only to differences in flavor of the starches.</p>

<h2 id="measurements-and-observations-at-each-step">Measurements and observations at each step</h2>

<p><em>Step 1.</em>
The Thai starch tended to clump together and stick to our measurement vessels, in contrast to the doce and azedo flours that did not compact together when measured and transferred between bowls. Jamming dynamics led Thai starch to often fly through the kitchen, across distances between approximately 5 - 10 cm.</p>

<p><em>Step 2.</em>
No flour mixing. No noteworthy observation.</p>

<p><em>Step 3.</em>
The scalding process felt different between samples from series “a” and series “b”. Generally, the doughs made from the Thai starch felt smoother and softer than those made from the sweet doce starch, which tended to be crumblier. The pure azedo batter, however, felt the crumbliest at this stage, as expected from our microscopy images.</p>

<figure class=" ">

</figure>

<p><em>A photo of the different doughs prepared; S stands for sour, A for Asian Sweet Starch, and B for Brazilian Sweet Starch. The upper row contains the doughs from series “a” and the lower one from series “b”. The doughy texture from series “a” at this stage can be clearly seen and contrasted with the series “b” in the lower row.</em></p>

<p><em>Step 4.</em>
While all samples became well-formed doughs at this stage, some of the observations above remain applicable here as well. The pure azedo dough was firmer than the others, while the dough made with pure Thai starch felt the softest and smoothest and was easily distinguishable from the dough made with pure doce flour. All doughs made with the Thai starch (the doughs from the “a” series) had more visible white clumps of starch that aggregated in the previous stage and so did not gelatinize.</p>

<p>To provide a more quantitative evaluation of how easily the different doughs deformed, we shaped them into cylinders and placed a 3.58kg mortar on top of them for 10 seconds. We then compared the height and diameters before and after weighing, removing the weight before taking our final measurements - these measurements are not in the linear deformation regime and evaluate plasticity rather than elasticity. The doughs often deformed differently across an axis due to misplacement of the mortar weight, so we took averages of the shortest and highest deformations, and always measured diameters transverse to the axis defined by shortest and highest height deformations.</p>

<p>Computing the (negative) ratio of changes in height to changes in diameter of these cylinders gives us a quantity related to the (inverse) Poisson’s ratio, a metric for the deformation (expansion / contraction) of a material perpendicular to the direction of applied stress. All of them are positive, as expected, as the cylinders expanded outwards when compressed vertically. We recorded no change in diameter for the pure azedo (sour starch) dough, whereas we did record a nonzero change in height; as this was likely due to a measurement error, we discarded this data point.</p>

<figure class=" ">
  
    
      <a href="/assets/images/pao_de_queijo_elasticity.png" title="pao de queijo">
          <img src="/assets/images/pao_de_queijo_elasticity.png" alt="graph" />
      </a>
    
  
  
</figure>

<p>Above we show plots generated comparing compression measurements for dough made using Thai starch and those using Brazilian sweet starch (doce) (error bars not included). The x-axis labels the percentage of the corresponding sweet starch in each dough. We had expected deformations to be of similar magnitudes when the amount of sour starch dominated over either sweet starch for both cases, and to diverge as the amount of sweet starches increased. In the end, more replicates and a more precise measurement procedure would be required to fully extract such a trend, if one exists. While dough made from Thai starch tended to flatten more along the height axis, our data measuring the increase in diameter (“diameter relaxation”) of the dough cylinders is somewhat inconclusive, with Thai and doce starches deforming more or less than each other depending on the percentage of sweet starch in the dough. At the extreme, dough made purely with Thai sweet starch tended to deform more along both vertical (height) and diametral axes than dough made with pure doce (rightmost data points of the top two plots), as we would expect from our previous observations that the Thai starch absorbs water more quickly and forms a softer dough.</p>

<p>Despite differences in the absolute axial and radial deformations of the doughs, the ratio of the plastic deformations of the doughs made purely with sweet starches converge to similar values independently of the origin of the starch (Thai or Brazilian; rightmost data point). One might expect this to mean that both doughs would behave similarly in the cooking process, though our previous notes regarding water absorption properties of the starches would suggest otherwise. In summary, our results suggest that doughs made with Thai starch are more deformable than those made from Brazilian starch, given that the former flatten around 5% more than the latter.</p>

<p><em>Same photo as before, but post-processing by adding eggs and cheese. All samples acquire a doughy texture, albeit the “a” series feeling smoother</em></p>

<p><em>Step 5.</em>
We shaped 4 balls of 32g each for each dough type for baking. We sprayed the oven with water to increase humidity (according to AI, this factor that should lead to thinner crusts [8]). According to our qualitative observation, sample series ib (75% Brazilian sweet starch) felt the hardest to shape.</p>

<p><em>Step 6.</em>
After baking we took measurements of the weights of all samples to evaluate water loss, cut samples in half vertically to evaluate the thickness of the crust, and took note of the crumb of the cheese breads. Our analysis indicates that, independently of the starch used, the breads lose about 15% of their weight due to baking (32 g to 28 g), with higher losses for higher concentrations of sweet starch. Breads made with Thai brand sweet tapioca starch tended to lose more water than those made with Brazilian sweet starch. This is surprising to us given the lower water content of the Asian sweet starch, but perhaps this means that the Brazilian starch has better water retention capacity. A potential explanation for this lies in the dense clumps of</p>

</figure>

<p>The figure above shows cross sections of our end products. Qualitative analysis of the outcomes led us to inconclusive remarks on trends, except for the sensorial observation that we should probably have included salt in the dough (which however might depend on the choice of cheese). The most noticeable effect is the flatness of the pão de queijo made by purely using Asian sweet starch (top right), which had been previously reported in Ref. [4]. Surprisingly, we unanimously felt that the recipe made purely with Brazilian sweet starch (bottom right) felt the airiest, opposite to the widespread belief that pure sour starch should lead to the lightest result [2][3]. One last, unsurprising, observation is the lack of sourness in the taste of recipes with less than 50% sour starch.</p>

<p>We estimated crust thickness using a ruler. All trials produced a crust of about 1 mm thick, set at around 15-20 minutes of cooking and resulting in a heat diffusion coefficient D ~ 0.01 mm^2/min. The dough made from 100% doce flour had the thinnest crust, we estimate around 0.5 mm, but our tools lacked the resolution to more precisely quantify these differences. Qualitatively, the crunchiness and dryness of the crusts decreased from the pure sour “s” sample (driest, crunchiest) towards doughs with more sweet starch. Pães de queijo made from at least 75% sweet starch (either variety) felt less dry and softer (i.e. easier to chew). This may indicate that the sour (azedo) starch absorbs more water than the others.</p>

<p>We baked the cheese breads in columns of four (four samples per trial) across two baking sheets, baking one tray at a time in the center rack of the oven to allow for more even heat circulation. However, since we baked multiple trials on the same pan, hot / cold spots within the oven may have contributed to some of our observations in the finished products.</p>

<p>The bottom of the pães de queijo tended to have a thicker crust than the tops. This aligned with our expectations that the surface area in more direct contact with a heating element (i.e. the heat-conducting metal pan) experienced greater heat transfer while baking and thus dried out to a greater extent than the crust exposed to the air, resulting in a thicker crust.</p>

<p><em>100% azedo: chewiest, hardest, flavorful but sour flavor may be too strong for some</em></p>

<p><em>100% doce: flavorless, thinnest crust, airiest</em></p>

<p><em>100% Thai starch: flat, chewy, spread out the most</em></p>

<p>Overall, we recommend using a combination of doce and azedo starches; the large air bubbles in the doce starch contribute to a light and fluffy texture while the azedo starch contributes flavor and structure. While our experience with the doce starch is somewhat at odds with other descriptions of it as contributing denseness and chewiness to the finished product, we believe our results can still be used as guidelines to help determine what combination of starches will achieve the most pleasurable texture for bakers looking to up their Brazilian cheese bread game.</p>

<p>For those interested in pushing our preliminary exploration here further, there are many avenues left to consider. Testing how moisture, fat content, and oven temperature affect the dough are natural next steps. In analogy to bread-making, higher hydration bread doughs may lead to thinner crusts and more open crumbs [11][12]. The tests we documented here could easily be attempted on blender recipes for Brazilian cheese bread [13], which naturally contain more liquid ingredients and are usually baked in a muffin pan to help set the shape of the breads. From our results above, we know that the different starches tested have different absorption properties of water. This observation is corroborated anecdotally - the best pão de queijo that one of us has had was with 100% azedo starch in a blender, resulting in a spongy bread with a slight chew, a drastically different outcome from what we observed in our experiments above with a drier dough. (this observation is strongly challenged by the purist opinion of our Brazilian author! But the whole point or our work is to determine how the recipe can be varied to please different palates and cultures)</p>

<p>We did not measure the temperature of our oven, but it is often the case that the temperature listed on the oven does not correspond to its actual temperature. Oven temperatures also tend to fluctuate considerably whenever the oven door is open, and it can take several minutes for it to subsequently get back up to temperature [14]. Oven temperatures also often require significant amounts of time to preheat to the specified temperature, even after the oven itself says it has finished preheating (this is what happens if you bake two trays of cookies in quick succession and find that the second tray bakes faster). Thus proper regulation and variation of the oven temperature using an oven-safe thermometer could provide valuable insights into how temperature affects crust thickness and texture.</p>

<p>We tasted and made observations on the crust texture of our Brazilian cheese breads within 2 hours of them being finished baking; however, a test of good pães de queijo is whether they remain moist and chewy over time. To test this, interested individuals could log observations after leaving the breads in a sealed container after baking so that humidity is retained during retrogradation, as often is the case when they are left inside heated displays in Brazilian cantinas. We expect cheese breads with thicker crusts to be drier and soften to a lesser extent than those with thinner crusts, given that more moisture from the bread interior is required to hydrate and soften a thicker crust than a thinner one.</p>

<p>Fat acts as a preservative, and the fat content in the cheese bread can also contribute to how well it holds up texturally over time. Browning of the cheese breads is intimately related to the breads’ fat and sugar content due to the Maillard reaction, so we would expect that given a fixed temperature, breads with more fat would require a shorter bake time (or alternatively, would be more easily overbaked, leading to a thicker crust). Fat can be controlled in a variety of ways here - fat / water contents of different cheeses vary, so different types of cheese may result in different textures, crumbs, and crust hardnesses; similarly, modifying the ratio of milk to water in the dough may give rise to denser or lighter final products with softer or harder crusts (given constant cooking time).</p>

I believe a team charter can be just as valuable for a scientific group, whether newly formed or well-established.</p>

<p>A group charter helps teams avoid conflicts and offers a framework for resolving them when they arise. These guidelines can set expectations around attendance, meeting etiquette (e.g., lateness, device use), and more. Below is a non-exhaustive list of team charter items and questions that might be relevant for scientific and other types of groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the acceptable tardiness for meetings? does prior notice matter?</li>
  <li>How much work-from-home is acceptable? What are the policies and limits?</li>
  <li>Is calendar blocking for uninterrupted work acceptable? By how much?</li>
  <li>Expected response times for emails and direct messages; how to classify urgency.</li>
  <li>How authorship for publications is defined?</li>
  <li>What allotted time acceptable to spend on skill-building, learning, and conferences?</li>
  <li>Note-taking responsibilities; is it important for the team, and should the duty rotate?</li>
  <li>Frequency and length of meetings with team leaders.</li>
</ul>

<p>Charters can also reflect a team’s core values, which can enhance hiring by helping candidates assess if they are a cultural fit. Likewise, they help hiring managers gauge how well candidates’ backgrounds and mindsets align with team values. These uses serve both for the purposes of evaluating general team-candidate alignment, but also for identifying complementary misalignments that can actually benefit all. Here is a set of core values I have been developing which can serve as an example or inspiration:</p>

<h5 id="1-passion-for-creation">1. Passion for Creation</h5>
<p>Science and engineering flow from the practitioner into the world, via their hands, voice and gestures. They express themselves through production outcomes, which may take the form of arguments, calculations, devices, simulations, and the like. Our group prioritizes a genuine drive for creative output, free of ego, and striving for daily contributions which are celebrated independently of being small or large. We also target the experimental plausibility or realization of ideas as the ultimate goal of all creation effort.</p>

<h5 id="2-quality-by-cultivation">2. Quality by cultivation</h5>
<p>The creative, socioeconomic, or cultural value of the engineer or scientist output is limited by the individual’s breadth and depth of knowledge. We cultivate solid learning practices and a relentless learning spirit, letting information flow from the world into us via our vision, hearing, attention, touch, and smell. We reject using jargon to hide misunderstandings, and strive for knowledge and understanding standards that ensure high quality for all we create.</p>

<h5 id="3-sustainability-as-the-scaffold">3. Sustainability as the scaffold</h5>
<p>Sustained creation and learning requires a healthy body, grit, a diversity of perspectives, and a respectful environment. We welcome all backgrounds and prioritize well-being and community, fostering connections within the team and beyond. This respect for sustainable practice reflects the accountability we have to society as scientists and engineers.</p>

<p>I’d like to acknowledge that this is not the first version of core values for scientific groups I ever thought about, and probably won’t be the last.

I find the experience enjoyable—much more engaging than some of my fellow scientists might expect. Many books in this field offer fresh, modern insights, often grounded in solid science. In this post, I’ll give a quick review of a recent favorite: “<a href="https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/drive-the-surprising-truth-about-what-motivates-us_daniel-h-pink/246588/?resultid=f8f87171-a9f2-404a-9610-3ab7705fcda7#edition=5980628&amp;idiq=3847557">Drive</a>”, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_H._Pink">Daniel H. Pink</a>.</p>

<p>Amusingly, the author makes my job easy: at the end of the book, he includes “social media” and “cocktail party” summaries. I’ll draw on some of those but also add my own insights.</p>

<p>The book’s main takeaway is that our traditional understanding of motivation—particularly for workers, employees, and even ourselves—is outdated. Not only is this “common wisdom” ineffective for modern needs, but it can also be harmful. What is this outdated wisdom? The author refers to it as the “carrots &amp; sticks” approach: rewarding positive behaviors or achievements and punishing shortcomings.</p>

<p>However, scientific research in psychology, economics, and management suggests a better path. The author argues for a new model of motivation based on three elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Autonomy</em> – The desire and ability to direct one’s own life.</li>
  <li><em>Mastery</em> – The drive to improve at something that matters.</li>
  <li><em>Purpose</em> – The sense that what we do is bigger than ourselves and serves others.</li>
</ul>

<p>I find that I can logically relate to many of the arguments put forward by the book supporting the structure above. For example, it suggests that repetitive tasks don’t necessarily have to harm motivation. A basketball player might shoot thousands of hoops to develop <em>mastery</em>, just as I’ve computed an unexciting number of derivatives to get good at calculus. What lies behind this behavior is the idea that humans are capable of intrinsic motivation. While “carrots &amp; sticks” are clear and easy-to-understand extrinsic motivators, they can undermine this intrinsic drive, which is often more powerful, especially for jobs that involve creativity or critical thinking.</p>

<p>D. Pink fills the book with examples showing how these “if-then” extrinsic motivators can harm motivation—crushing creativity, lowering performance, and even discouraging positive behavior. To his credit, the author also acknowledges cases where extrinsic motivation can be beneficial, offering insights into how to align it with the three elements of autonomy, mastery, and purpose. One practical proposition is to shift from “if-then” to “now-that” rewards: offering unexpected rewards only after a task is completed, which can boost motivation without overshadowing intrinsic drive.</p>

<p>Perhaps my favorite idea in the book is that while extrinsic effects don’t usually work for improving motivation, the lack of a reasonable baseline of extrinsic incentives can be highly damaging. As the book points out, things like salaries and benefits need to be taken out of the equation as soon as possible. Workers should receive competitive pay and benefits to create a basic sense of fairness and stability for themselves and their loved ones. Beyond that point, large bonuses or harsh penalties won’t boost productivity or efficiency. That’s when the focus should shift to the three key elements: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. I can definitely see this position mattering in scientific environments.</p>

<p>A key strength of the book is that its arguments aren’t just the author’s opinions—they’re grounded in scientific research by behavioral scientists like (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_L._Deci">Edward Deci</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</a>, provided we should appreciate some of these figures may be a bit controversial. I also find that the book’s insights into the role of Purpose in motivation echo themes explored by philosophers, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byung-Chul_Han">Byung-chul Han</a> in his work, “<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262533379/the-agony-of-eros/">Agony of Eros</a>”.</p>

<p>As with any complex topic, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to the problem of motivation (particularly in a scientific environment). Still, I find this book thoughtful and full of valuable insights—whether for organizations facing challenges or those looking to elevate their practices.</p>]]></content><author><name>Pedro LS Lopes</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my journey to expand my knowledge from physics to effective management practices, I maintain a steady, yet unhurried reading pace.

We have also covered some creative practices and opportunities to mitigate some of the risks involved and challenges identified.</p>

<p>This is my own attempt at contributing something to this cause. Keeping track of a group’s finances can be tricky; being able to forecast one’s funding capacity, measuring opportunities against burning rates, can be the difference between being caught unprepared or stably honoring the trust other researchers put on the team manager. Thus, I introduce the “Cash Flower”, a simple Monte Carlo program to provide financial forecasts for an organization funded by typical means a researcher may encounter. Find the source and installation insructions on <a href="https://github.com/pedrolslopes/Cash_Flower">this repo</a>.</p>

<p>Financial data can be input in four different types of categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stable</strong>: Constant sources of income or expense (e.g., salaries, bills, IP licenses), characterized by monthly average values and variances.</li>
  <li><strong>Singles</strong>: One-time revenue or expense events (e.g., rare large sales, purchases).</li>
  <li><strong>Recurrent</strong>: Repeated cash flows triggered after an initial event (e.g., long-term deals, scholarships, sales or purchase of established products).</li>
  <li><strong>Project</strong>: Milestone-based cash flows tied to project success and timing (e.g. grants).</li>
</ul>

<p>Users may flexibly encode data from their different funding streams in the categories above, with pre-determined probabilities of realizing each event, according to preferences, convenience, or mindset. No single right way of doing it.</p>

<p>Given a set of financial data, Cash Flower outputs some traditional data analytics upon estimating several scenarios of success or failure at achieving revenue or expenses. These analytics include, for the moment, monthly revenue/expense reports, an analysis of the accumulated funding in the organization as function of time, and the risk of going negative. Here goes what the generated plots can look like for some example data:</p>

<figure class=" ">
  
    
      <a href="/assets/images/cash_flower_analysis_example.png" title="Cash Flower Data Analysis">
          <img src="/assets/images/cash_flower_analysis_example.png" alt="graph" />
      </a>
    
  
  
</figure>

<p>This program is open source and all are welcome to contribute to the project. Some of my current ideas for improvement include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better visuals for histogram of monthly expenses and gains.</li>
  <li>Change data gathering and reading scheme so users can take resources from Excel spreadsheets or Pandas dataframes.</li>
  <li>Plot categorized data according to the different types of cashflow events, evaluating how important each is at a given time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bug reports are also welcome, particularly identifying situations where the program fails!</p>

<p>I hope Cash Flower will help scientific managers and individual contributors alike to better monitor the financial health of their endeavours!</p>

<p><em>For this one I owe a big thanks to my wife, Marianne, for the support, helping with debugging, and feature suggestions. Hope this will be useful to her one day! I also owe the idea for creating this program to Yuval Boger, “The Superposition Guy”.</em></p>]]></content><author><name>Pedro LS Lopes</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I have written posts on the challenges and subtleties of keeping a healthy funding stream for a scientific team.

Your team, whether students or professionals, relies on you as the scientific leader to provide a stable environment for creation, skill development, and professional growth. Breaching that trust can be a significant setback.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01570-y?utm_source=Live+Audience&amp;utm_campaign=29096efd03-nature-briefing-daily-20240529&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_b27a691814-29096efd03-52510728">recent article</a> caught my attention on the topic of “what to do when funding runs dry.” Funding for science can be intermittent if your organization lacks a mechanism for continuous stream support. It often falls on the scientific leader or manager to constantly negotiate or sell the importance of their work. If they actively participate in research and the funding landscape is unpredictable, conflicting priorities – as many scientists dislike the “selling” aspect of the job – may lead to overlooking impending financial threats to the team.</p>

<p>The article presents several suggestions on how to deal with this reality, some of which I was unaware were possible. In this post, I will focus on those suggestions rather than the statistics on funding difficulties in certain countries. I will expand on ideas mentioned in the article, as well as bring my own suggestions based on my experience and learning from my professional network.</p>

<h3 id="the-spts-9-thoughts-on-how-to-deal-with-intermittent-funding">The SPTS 9 thoughts on how to deal with intermittent funding:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Communicate with Program Officers</strong>: If your funding sources are usually governmental grants, talk to your program officers in case of trouble. While they may be demanding on proposal acceptance, their goal is likely the success of science and education. They are there to help you. Challenges in getting funded are not personal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Know your program officers</strong>: while on that point, note that knowing your program officers and vice versa can really help you in understanding their priorities, and them understand details your interests and provide you feedback. So, find opportunities to meet them, for example as mentioned in <a href="https://pedrolslopes.github.io/2024/02/25/Policy_sabbatical.html">my post</a> on sabbaticals in government.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Utilize Bridge Grants</strong>: Some institutions offer “bridge grants” – emergency mechanisms to help researchers connect different funding periods in case of trouble, particularly when pivoting to new research directions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Engage with Your Employer</strong>: And on the same flavor as above, your employer (university or otherwise) is not your enemy either. Talk to them – they may have mechanisms in place to help you connect between grants or customer projects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>And vice-versa</strong>: Maybe the above is also a tip for employers to think about setting up such mechanisms in place! The “group rejuvenation sabbatical” mentioned in he article sounds like an innovative idea!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Diversify Funding Sources</strong>: Hedge your odds by applying to multiple sources of support (different funding agencies, industry relations, or philanthropy (see also my previous post on <a href="https://pedrolslopes.github.io/2024/03/31/Philantropy.html">the latter</a>)). However, be cautious not to let writing too many applications overwhelm you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Plan Ahead</strong>: The article mentions the importance of “Planning Ahead”, and includes some interesting tips on no-cost extensions to spend unused funds. Proper planning helps predict trouble. Run adequate budget analyses for your lab, including your cash runway. Stay tuned for a tool I’m developing to assist with this!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Invest in Supply-Chain Autonomy</strong>: Experimentalists tend to struggle more with funding than theorists. Consider investing in your supply-chain autonomy by machining your own parts. While it won’t solve a funding gap, it will be more cost-effective, mitigate risks, boost team confidence, and perhaps lead to entrepreneurial opportunities. Tapping in the open-sourcing community and modern computer-aided design and manufacture can really provide students with meaningful skills for future work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaborate and Share Resources</strong>: Team up with other researchers and share resources. Teams may have better odds of getting larger, longer-lasting funds as part of a program. If your curiosity aligns with a funding agency’s mission, mission-oriented programs can also represent good opportunities.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Funding science and research will always be challenging, but it is undeniably important work. If mechanisms for stable funding did not exist, research universities would not function as institutions.

While most of my posts are based on my own experience, observations, or creations in science and scientific management, I wanted to bring in some opinions beyond my biases. So hereby I start “Words of Wisdom”, a blogging series where I shortly interview seasoned professionals in the world of science management. I will tap their expertise and bring you their inspiring words to burning questions.</p>

<p>For this first entry, I bring words from my own work colleague Shengtao Wang. Shengtao is a quantum information scientist with a career spanning Singapore, Michigan, and most recently Harvard University in Boston. He is one of QuEra Computing’s first employees and manages a 10+ team of theorists and computer scientists working in algorithms and applications.</p>

<p>Here we go for Shengtao’s words of wisdom:</p>

<p class="notice--warning"><em>SPTS:</em> When it comes to time allocation, what would you say are the main challenges and peculiarities of managing a scientific team?</p>

<p class="notice--info"><em>SW:</em> In a fast-paced environment where priorities are fluid, aligning a team’s priorities and motivations becomes crucial. If you manage to do this effectively, even when delays occur in some projects, you will know that the team’s strong motivation is focused on the highest priorities.</p>

<p class="notice--warning"><em>SPTS:</em> How do you view motivation? What are the key factors that keep a scientific team motivated?</p>

<p class="notice--info"><em>SW:</em> To stay motivated, scientists truly need room for creativity and critical thinking. Discovery holds cultural importance for scientists. I believe it’s crucial for team managers and leaders to secure and respect this space for creativity.</p>

<p class="notice--warning"><em>SPTS:</em> What is the main “danger” or “tripping hazard” a scientific manager may face?</p>

<p class="notice--info"><em>SW:</em> When a scientific leader lacks a strong vision and a clear direction, the team risks becoming mediocre, and their output may be less impactful. On the other hand, team managers and leaders should avoid micromanaging how goals and visions are achieved. Instead, they should allow highly motivated individuals to find their own paths to success.</p>

<p class="notice--warning"><em>SPTS:</em> How do you distinguish the above in an academic vs private environments?</p>

<p class="notice--info"><em>SW:</em> In my view, the industry setting requires considerably more management due to many more competing factors and priorities. Academic labs can thrive on self-organization and adapt naturally to changing research directions. In contrast, in industry settings, it is crucial for individual and team goals to align with the company’s vision and objectives. Consequently, more management and coordination both within and between teams are essential for overall success.</p>

<p>That is it! Thanks Shengtao for your Words of Wisdom!

That together with, for the first time, being asked to do the technical review of a book for a friend. All relevant experience and service, if anyone ask me! But I am ready to come back to Setting Physics to Stun!</p>

<p>This time I want to visit the topic of how adequate PhD assessment is. This topic is a little more academic than general scientific management, but I had some interactions with friends on the topic which it got me thinking. Also, in my (quantum) industry, I am frequently questioned by junior students on whether they should pursue a PhD to seek a scientific career in the field. So maybe this is a good chance to address these questions a bit.</p>

<p>The topic was brought to me by reading a Nature Editorial <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00718-0?utm_source=Live+Audience&amp;utm_campaign=adeec3770a-briefing-dy-20240313&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_b27a691814-adeec3770a-52510728">“Bring the PhD assessment to the twenty-first century”</a> which was followed up by a poll. When I brought this up to colleagues that work in academia, I feel like they did not fully appreciate the issue being raised. Their claim was that “the market - both academic and private - seems to be happy with the process” given that rarely a person with a PhD - in physics, at least - find themselves unemployed. Fair statement. The editorial article itself highlights that not all PhD training is stuck in the past. But it strikes me as true that innovation and discovery in the field of education is struggling to find its way into the doctorate process (and generally in higher education at research institutions, given that successful postdocs and grad students - again, at least in physics - tend to be discouraged from engaging with teaching research too deeply).</p>

<p>To try and ground this conversation, and hopefully help junior students understand what the commitment to do a PhD entails, let’s at least try to formalize a definition of the purpose of a PhD program:</p>

<p class="notice--warning">The <a href="https://www.qaa.ac.uk/docs/qaa/guidance/guidance-rdap-academic-staff-mar-2014.pdf?sfvrsn=356f781_6">British Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education</a> states that a doctorate student should demonstrate the creation and interpretation of new knowledge that extends the forefront of the discipline and merits publication.</p>

<p>This definition may vary slightly from place to place, but makes it clear why a PhD experience can be relevant in industries of promising but not yet mature technologies (quantum tech, gene therapy, arguably AI before 2023):  the path to commercialization and productization of the tech requires it to finish evolving, often requiring multiple knowledge breakthroughs at the forefront – what a PhD trains for.</p>

<p>The editorial cites a couple of relevant references, <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:07291f0e-e80b-4b06-a6af-b3ac8b90a00e">a looong thesis</a> and a <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09684880310471506/full/html">short-but-not-so-recent article</a>. I confess the thesis was too much of a commitment for me to study, but the article may help us itemize some concrete examples about what parts of the PhD assessment process do not have uniform clarity throughout the community:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to determine a PhD committee? Should the student have a say? Should it be formed by experts only?</li>
  <li>What matters most: the thesis write-up or the defense oral presentation? (Both are typically required. Neither is typically sufficient)</li>
  <li>What is the purpose of the oral presentation? What should be its length? Is it just a rite of passage? Should it be private or public?</li>
</ul>

<p>The list goes on.</p>

<p>Again, many, if not most, of these questions are decidedly addressed in the regulations and administrative rules of specific programs at different universities. So, for new students, perhaps these bring you some suggestions of questions to ask once you get accepted in a program. The broader questions are: (i) why there is no more common agreement across different institutions about how these should be organized? And (ii) how different choices for the above impact the experience and learning of the students?</p>

<p>I hope this brings up some relevant perspectives on scientific management on what says respect to the scientists themselves, and helps them analyze the culture of the organizations they decide to join.</p>]]></content><author><name>Pedro LS Lopes</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A (total!) eclipse, travel, and hackathons have slowed down my blogging.

Nonetheless, I’ve been mulling over some discussion-worthy topics!</p>

<p>The different funding mechanisms for science, both in academia and elsewhere, have been on my mind lately. This reminded me of two insightful articles from late 2022 and early 2023 – one in <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article/75/11/24/2848605/Philanthropy-plays-a-growing-role-in-funding-US">Physics Today</a> and another in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00077-2">Careers Feature section of Nature</a>. These articles delve into the role of philanthropy in supporting research (which I guess naturally plays a more significant part in science backed by academia or non-profit organizations, rather than in private institutions). The topic also resonates with the recent news of the super-wealthy’s request at Davos, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/17/wealth-tax-super-rich-davos-abigail-disney-brian-cox-valerie-rockefeller#:~:text=%E2%80%9COur%20request%20is%20simple%3A%20we,harm%20our%20nations'%20economic%20growth.">asking to be more properly taxed</a>. It seems plausible to me that this request stems from a situation where inequality grew so big that some wealthy individuals are struggling to even donate impactfully. But I digress.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article/75/11/24/2848605/Philanthropy-plays-a-growing-role-in-funding-US">first article</a> from Physics Today analyzes the growing influence of private donors on the physical sciences and contrasts this source with other traditional ways to fund science, namely federal grants. The article features an intriguing figure, which, with a bit of digging, can be traced back to the strategic planning of the <a href="https://sciencephilanthropyalliance.org/#">Science Philanthropy Alliance</a> organization. Since the document is public, I’ve reproduced the corresponding figure here:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/sciencephilalliance.png" alt="image-center" class="align-center" style="width: 70%;" /></p>

<p>The red curve represents sources of philanthropic origin via non-profit foundations and donations to higher education institutions (and their endowment funds). The contribution from philanthropic sources may be even higher, as this data excludes individual donors.</p>

<p>As the article suggests, this plot tells a story: historically, contributions from wealthy individuals to science were of central importance. In the US, names like Rockefeller and Carnegie are associated with several institutions of higher education. The Cold War years witnessed a sharp increase in government support for science, and private funders shifted their efforts elsewhere. However, public support for science has been decreasing proportionally, and philanthropic sources have correspondingly risen as donors turn their attention back to helping researchers as a way to give back to society.</p>

<p>Private donations can positively influence science in many ways. The process of spending resources can be less bureaucratic and more flexible. It can more easily allow pivoting research directions – something challenging to do mid-grant when specific deliverables are requested during project planning – and can provide a pathway for scientists to transition to new areas of focus. This reconversion is typically difficult to achieve, as public funds tend to require a prior reputation in a field for researchers to successfully obtain funding. The article also mentions how the flexibility of philanthropic funding can foster more risk-taking in science, a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00929-5?utm_source=Live+Audience&amp;utm_campaign=45bbc57f69-briefing-dy-20240326&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_b27a691814-45bbc57f69-52510728">subject of intense discussion</a>. Finally, private funds can complement other sources; for example, some sources can address only capital or infrastructure expenditures, while private funds tend to cover personnel and operations – a perfect match!</p>

<p>However, not everything is perfect and easy. The article gathers advice for caution from scientists previously successful at garnering donor funding. These include being mindful of</p>
<ul>
  <li>money that is too restrictive,</li>
  <li>donors who expect too much recognition,</li>
  <li>and donors who feel they have the right to call the shots (like on hiring decisions).</li>
</ul>

<p>Another issue I see: as the article mentions, securing philanthropic funds requires a good dose of personal touch and relationships. Access to the right communities and the type of engagement and relationships developed depend heavily on opportunities and culture. This may pose a barrier for individuals from minority groups and affect diversity, equity, and inclusion outcomes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00077-2">The second article</a> provides different resources and information on the topic. It takes the position of interviewing scientists who successfully obtained donations for their research and shares their stories. The result is a good collection of advice on navigating the process. On a personal note, one of the interviewees tells some inspiring stories from his position as a researcher in Brazil and how different philanthropic organizations such as the <a href="https://serrapilheira.org/en/">Instituto Serra Pilheira</a> – apparently the only foundation to support science with private donations in Brazil – helped him remain engaged with the global scientific community. If you’ve read my other blog entries, you’ll remember me mentioning the issues surrounding the Brazilian scientific diaspora caused by, among other reasons, the insecurity of funding for science in Brazil.</p>

<p>In summary, both articles agree: some hedging is advised. Researchers should try to view the ecosystem of funding alternatives holistically and not bet on a single direction, not overlooking traditional federal grants, but remembering that significant alternatives exist.</p>]]></content><author><name>Pedro LS Lopes</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A busy week of teaching and preparing for an upcoming trip to Quebec to witness the eclipse left little time for blogging.

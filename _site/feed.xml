I can’t believe I am finally starting this! Welcome to “Set Physics to Stun”, my blog on physics, scientific management, and other topics relevant for intellectually engaged folks.</p>

<p>My goal is to promote better practices in scientific environments in general, improving inclusiveness, helping all the scientific community be better to itself to enjoy a more balanced journey of discovery. For that, a big topic for me is how to make science more socially connected, after all the priviledge to engage in curious inquiry does not happen in vacuum.</p>

<p>So here is my plan. I love physics and through my scientific career I came to realize that, to achieve the research performance expected for academic jobs, many physicists are pushed to specialize quite early. This is a platform to counter-balance that and bring to surface deep, beautiful, topics in basic - or not so basic - physics that I believe can help broaden the view of researchers in all stages of their careers.</p>

<p>In my view, science is a human endeavour and thus social. By broadening the awareness on these different subjects, I hope professional researchers will be able to improve how they communicate with general audiences from plural backgrounds, and cross pollinate with other fields of inquiry. Similarly, I am hoping these topics will help my non-technical readers appreciate some of the subtleties that are often are deeply rooted with the pleasant aesthetics of physical phenomena.</p>

<p>But wait, there is more! Through my professional life I have come across many academics who struggle with the managerial aspects of their jobs, with funding programs that are not set for success, and a with general disconnect between the so-called “academic ivory tower” and society. Improving this reality, I believe, is crucial for a more responsible steering of (typically public) funds and preventing denialism. For creating more meaninful funding streams and less inertial organizations. So I intend to use this space as well as a forum to discuss some ideas and experiences I have on scientific management, brainstorm with readers, and help develop solutions for academics and scientific managers alike. I want to promote a socially connected scientific entrepreneurial spirit among my fellow physicists and reassure the general public that yes, we think about it. We are not just self-perpetuating the status quo.</p>

<p>This blog has been long in the making; I probably came up with the Star Trek pun for its name some 3 years ago. But now this is finally happening! If you share my passion for these topics, and my vision to how address them, stick around! Read and comment. This is a safe and open space, and all are welcome!</p>]]></content><author><name>Pedro LS Lopes</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is it! I can’t believe I am finally starting this!

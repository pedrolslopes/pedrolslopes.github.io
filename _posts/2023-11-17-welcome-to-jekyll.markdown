This is it! I can't believe I am finally starting this! Welcome to "Set Physics to Stun", my blog on physics, scientific management, and other topics relevant for intellectually engaged folks. 

My goal is to promote better practices in scientific environments in general, improving inclusiveness, helping all the scientific community be better to itself to enjoy a more balanced journey of discovery. For that, a big topic for me is how to make science more socially connected, after all the priviledge to engage in curious inquiry does not happen in vacuum. 

So here is my plan. I love physics and through my scientific career I came to realize that, to achieve the research performance expected for academic jobs, many physicists are pushed to specialize quite early. This is a platform to counter-balance that and bring to surface deep, beautiful, topics in basic - or not so basic - physics that I believe can help broaden the view of researchers in all stages of their careers.

In my view, science is a human endeavour and thus social. By broadening the awareness on these different subjects, I hope professional researchers will be able to improve how they communicate with general audiences from plural backgrounds, and cross pollinate with other fields of inquiry. Similarly, I am hoping these topics will help my non-technical readers appreciate some of the subtleties that are often are deeply rooted with the pleasant aesthetics of physical phenomena.

But wait, there is more! Through my professional life I have come across many academics who struggle with the managerial aspects of their jobs, with funding programs that are not set for success, and a with general disconnect between the so-called "academic ivory tower" and society. Improving this reality, I believe, is crucial for a more responsible steering of (typically public) funds and preventing denialism. For creating more meaninful funding streams and less inertial organizations. So I intend to use this space as well as a forum to discuss some ideas and experiences I have on scientific management, brainstorm with readers, and help develop solutions for academics and scientific managers alike. I want to promote a socially connected scientific entrepreneurial spirit among my fellow physicists and reassure the general public that yes, we think about it. We are not just self-perpetuating the status quo. 

This blog has been long in the making; I probably came up with the Star Trek pun for its name some 3 years ago. But now this is finally happening! If you share my passion for these topics, and my vision to how address them, stick around! Read and comment. This is a safe and open space, and all are welcome!

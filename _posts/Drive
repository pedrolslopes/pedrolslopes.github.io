In my efforts to broaden my education from physics to include effective managerial practices, I try to keep a slow but steady reading rythm. My experience has been quite pleasant, definitely not as staid as most of my scientifically minded colleagues expect of the subject. As it turns out, there are a lot of titles which bring modern thinking, quite often based on solid science, to the field of management. In this post, I want to briefly review a book I recently enjoyed: "[Drive](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/drive-the-surprising-truth-about-what-motivates-us_daniel-h-pink/246588/?resultid=f8f87171-a9f2-404a-9610-3ab7705fcda7#edition=5980628&idiq=3847557)", by [Daniel H. Pink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_H._Pink).

Amusigly, the author makes my job very easy: in the end of the book he creates a "social media" and "cocktail party" summaries for advertising and starting conversations. I will use some of that, but bring a bit of my own insight on the read. 

The big picture summary of the book suggests that common wisdom regarding motivation of people in general - in particular workers, employees, even ourselves - is outdated. It is not only inneffective for modern needs, it can often be damaging. What is this "common wisdom" referred to? That is what the author refers to as "carrots & sticks", that is, rewards for reinforcing positive attitudes or achievements towards a goal, and punishments when those attitudes are insufficient or misplaced. The author argues and exemplifies that scientific experiments in psichology, economics, and administration suggest a better way. This way involves substituting motivation by carrots & sticks for motivation based on 3 different elements: (1) *Autonomy* - the desire and capacity to direct one's own life; (2) *Mastery* - the urge to improve oneself at something that matters; (3) *Purpose* - the sense or feeling that what one do is bigger than themselves, serving others. 

Many of the arguments of the book are quite interesting. For example, the idea that repetitive tasks do not need to negatively affect motivation (a basketball player may shoot thousands of balls towards a loop nonstop, just because of a desire to develop *mastery* over a topic. I can guarantee I computed an arguably unexciting amount of derivatives in my life to get good at calculus). The whole point is that human beings are seen as capable of having intrinsic motivation to do something. And carrots & sticks, while visible and easy to understand extrinsic motivators, can damage the intrinsic motivators, usually seen as more powerful, particularly for jobs that involve creative of critical thinking. 

The author populates the book with examples where these "if-then" extrinsic motivators can be damaging to drive, including crushing creativity, lowering performance, crowding out good behavior, and more. In an act of what I would call scientific honesty, the author also explores situations where extrinc motivation can be positive, but always providing perspectives on how to implement that in a way that incorporates the three elements above. To make it concrete, a good practice for using extrinsic motivators in a productive way is to turn "if-then" into "now-that" events, where extrinsic rewards for a task come as surprises and are offered only once the task is complete.

Perhaps my favorite idea on the book is that while extrinsic effects don't usually work for improving motivation, the absence of a reasonable baseline definitely can be damaging to it. As is put in the book: things like salaries and benefits must be taken out of the equation as soon as possible. Competitive payment and benefits must be provided to the workers, generating a basic sense of fairness and stability to fend for one's self and beloveds. After that, huge bonuses or dreaded punishments don't really help improve productivity and efficiency. That becomes the area of elements (1-3) above.

As sign of a treaty that points to truth, much of the arguments in the book are not based on the author's simple opinions. They are based on the scientific works of behavioral scientists ([Edward Deci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_L._Deci), [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi), and others, some of them, provided, a bit controversial figures). I personally feel that some of the arguments in the role *Purpose* play in motivation are reminiscent or aligned with findings of philosophers as well (see [Byung-chul Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byung-Chul_Han)'s "[Agony of Eros](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262533379/the-agony-of-eros/)"). 

As for any complex topic, no universal recommendation should cover all scenarios. Still, I find this a thoughtful book, which certainly bears useful information for struggling organizations and organizations ready to step up with their practices alike!

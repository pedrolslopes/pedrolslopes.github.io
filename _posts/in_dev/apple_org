I have recently come across <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/11/how-apple-is-organized-for-innovation?ab=at_art_art_1x4_s01">an interesting overview</a>  of Apple's managerial organization by Harvard Business Review. This piece stresses how surprising it is that Apple, despite its large scale, manages its operations via functional teams, rather than via business units with their independent financial duties. It also emphasizes the importance of this management choice for them, and how positively consequential this can be for organizations that operate in a highly innovation-focused space.

That got me thinking about what lessons learned can be efficiently transfered from Apple's experience to the broader research/science management space. After all, all scientific organizations depend on being at the forefront of innovation to thrive. So I'd like to focus this post on drawing corresponding parallels and collecting possible recommendations.

Perhaps the first point we should acknowledge is that management processes should always be function of the complexity of the work one needs to do. Many scientific managers just run smaller groups inside bigger organizations (either in industry or academia) and with 5 or so team members, complicated managerial processes don't really add. Still, these groups often operate inside bigger organizations that do benefit from careful administration for their success. If science or innovation is key to those organizations (again, be them private or not), then maybe the lessons here remain relevant. In other words, we would do well to evaluate how to scale down the processes and organization ideas learned from Apple when bringing them to dedicated groups.

So what are the key elements of functional management? 
- experts leading experts
- discretionary leadership
- ...

Experts leading experts, deciding to become leaders not because they love being bosses, but rather stepping up to a call due to a need. => maybe academia should be more aware of this. People become professors because they are amazing researchers, not for leading

[Nature briefing](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01570-y?utm_source=Live+Audience&utm_campaign=29096efd03-nature-briefing-daily-20240529&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_b27a691814-29096efd03-52510728)

As a research manager, funding your group is a most serious activity. Advance of science requires a workforce. That workforce (be it formed of students or professionals) will count in the scientific leader or manager - either would be responsible, if not the same person - to provide a stable environment to work, master new skills, and grow professionally. Breaking that trust can be a nearly impossible to recover setback. 

Lots of comments on the statistics of how hard it can be to secure funding. Will leave that to who would like to read the full article. I will stick to the suggestions on how to deal with the problem of keeping steady funding. Many are referred to one way or another in the article, and I expand on them. Others are my own suggestions, based on my experience and learnings from my professional network. 

For private labs, this topic is sensitive enough that I haven't found a way to discuss in public. So let's stick to the academic case. Situation is very different in different countries.

- In case of trouble, talk to your program officers. Despite being demanding on what proposals will get accepted or not, their goal is the success of science. They won't push you back for nothing. Challenges researchers may find at getting funded are not personal. While at this point, revisit my post about the importance of sabbaticals in government. Knowing your program managers can be vital.
- In some countries, funding organizations have mechanisms like bridge grants. These seem to be emergency mechanisms that aim at helping researchers connect different funding periods in case trouble happens when applying for a next funding round. This is particularly relevant if someone is trying to pivot to new research themes.
- Your employer is not your enemy either. Talk to them (university or otherwise). They may have mechanisms in place to help you connect between grants, or customer projects in case you work in a privately funded environment with rarefied customer opportunities.
- Maybe the above is also a tip for employers to think about setting up such mechanisms in place! The group rejuvenation sabbatical is a particularly innovative idea!
- Hedge your odds of funding by applying to multiple sources of support (different funding agencies, maybe industry relations, or philantropy (see my previous post on [the latter](https://pedrolslopes.github.io/2024/03/31/Philantropy.html))). Also, don't let writing grant applications take you away from your other duties. As I am just giving my opinions, I'd say that making the good friends in the right places to boost your chances is still a more efficient approach.
- The article mentions the importance of "Planning Ahead", and includes some interesting tips on no-cost extensions to spend unused funds. In any case, proper planning really helps predict trouble. So, make sure to run adequate budget analyses for your lab, including your cash runway. Stay tuned as I am putting together a tool to help with that!
- Experimentalists tend to struggle more with funding than theorists. In that case, consider invest in your supply-chain autonomy. While this won't help solve a funding gap issue, it will certainly mitigate risks. Machining one's own parts is not only a more cost-effective way of operating a lab, but also a meaningful skill for students, and will bring resilience to your lab in lean days, and boost the confidence of your team. Tying that with modern computer-aided design and manufacture can really provide students with meaningful skills for future work. 
- Team up! Share resources. Teams with multiple researchers may have better odds of getting funded, and those funds may be larger and last longer, as part of a program. If your curiosity aligns with a particular bigger mission of a funding agency, that may help keep things stable.

Quick comment: mind the "Bridging the gap" section. The comments in the 3rd paragraph can sound ambiguous and feel like refer to individual contributors having potential "funding issues". I believe the person was referring to PIs.

Funding science and research is and will always be hard. The rate of conversion to society-changing products is low for curiosity-based research. The same applies in several mission-based research cases too. But science is undeniably important work. If developing mechanisms for stably funding that work really did not exist, research universities would not really exist as institutions.

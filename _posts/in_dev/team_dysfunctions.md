Last post of the year! Hoping to finish strong!

In September 2024, we posted about the factors driving an individual's motivation in a scientific team. This time we will expand the scope and consider what makes a team work well together. 

This year, I read a lot about management, trying to educate myself more on the topic and trying to connect with the life of and challenges faced by scientists. The content of this post is built on "The Five Dysfunctions of a Team", by Patrick Lencioni. The author is a well-known figure in private industry, coaching companies for organizational health and team work. He has wrote several books, many widel acclaimed. So, probably we should start with a disclaimer that the "sociological" theories of the book have found deep appreciation among several leaders and corporations, and have been built upon empirical experience by the author, but are not rigorously tested by scienc (to my knowledge). Still, human experience is quite valuable, and the thoughts in the book definitely got me thinking.

The Five Dysfunctions of a Team is composed of mostly a long story where the author role plays (a quite common practice in business training, I come to learn) characters going through conflict in a company, but being saved by a new CEO who has mastery of the concepts that lead to such team dysfunctionality. The author, afterwards, re-describes the ideas in detail. The five dysfunctions are organized in a pyramid as follows

- Absence of Trust -> invulnerability
- Fear of Conflict -> artificial harmony
- Lack of Commitment -> ambiguity
- Avoidance of Accountability -> low standards
- Inattention to results -> status and ego focus

The author also emphasizes (in a good attempt to sell another of his books) that not all people are capable of being a team player, and that paying attention to these virtues can help in hiring and fostering more productive behavior in colleagues.

humility (most precious virtue and antidote for all sin) => allows vulnerability to be palatable and creates possibility of trust among human beings he considers to be inclined to self-protection

need to ented risky discomfort is at base of pyramid coming w trust

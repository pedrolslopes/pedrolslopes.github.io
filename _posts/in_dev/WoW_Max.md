*SPTS:* SPTS: Open-Quantum sits between research, teaching, and manufacturing. How do you define “success” so you know you’re on track, and how do different stakeholders shape priorities and which institutions you choose to partner with?

*SPTS:* What feels different about coordinating a distributed, mostly volunteer/open-source effort like Open-Quantum compared to a traditional lab team—and how do you keep people engaged and organized, especially in a hardware rather than pure software open-source project?

*SPTS:* You’re leading as a student, often working with people who are more senior, or in different institutions. What have you learned about building credibility and authority without relying on job titles?

*SPTS:* Building deployable AMO teaching systems means juggling design, suppliers, manufacture, assembly, and support. Which part of that pipeline was the steepest learning curve for you, and how did you climb it? What do you think is the hardest for most scientists/engineers?

*SPTS:* What advice would you give students who want to start community-driven initiatives but worry it will “dilute” their CV—and what should mentors keep in mind when supporting this kind of entrepreneurial path? Has Open-Quantum changed how you think about good scientific mentorship?

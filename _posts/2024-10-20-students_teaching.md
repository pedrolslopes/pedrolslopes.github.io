Lazy blogging. I don't want to reblog a topic someone else just did. So I will just point people to this interesting piece on [should students teach?](https://condensedconcepts.blogspot.com/2024/06/should-phd-students-choose-to-teach.html) at Condensed Concepts. I think the only perspective I should add is that even in private industry, training is extremely important. Onboarding new team members always takes times, does not matter how well-prepared they are. Experience in doing it effectively can be helpful. Understanding the value of it can help save time and money to your organization. Particularly for managers: if you want things done a given way, common recommendation is to train your direct reports on how that is. 

Even more importantly, do not forget to tell them "why" you want things that way. It will help people not going out of line, or help you get them back in place when they do.

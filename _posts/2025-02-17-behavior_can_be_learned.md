Short post from a big lesson. Recently I was in a conference and me and other scientists were discussing how easy or hard it was to get strong performers in a scientific team depending on different environments. One of our colleagues, well-intentioned, mentioned that his organization didn't always get the most committed performers, but every-now-and-then they would find a gem that could move forward quite independently.

At this point, another of our colleagues - who deserves praise for educating us all, so thanks Alex Cooper-Roy - interjected. Paraphrasing, he reminded us that commitment and dedication to a cause or a project are behavioural traits and behaviour can be learned. So instead of selecting contributors according to how they innately behave as we expect, perhaps we should spend more time fostering those behaviors. Communicating clearly what are our expectations, affirmatively supporting behaviors that are aligned with those expectations, providing constructive feedback when they are not aligned. A good lesson for science managers: "behaviour can be learned". Thanks again Alex!

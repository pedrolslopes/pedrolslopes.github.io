Starting a new blog series at Set Physics to Stun! While most of my posts are based on my own experience, observations, or creations in science and scientific management, I wanted to bring in some opinions beyond my biases. So hereby I start "Words of Wisdom", a blogging series where I shortly interview seasoned professionals in the world of science management. I will tap their expertise and bring you their inspiring words to burning questions.

For this first entry, I bring words from my own work colleague Shengtao Wang. Shengtao is a quantum information scientist with a career spanning Singapore, Michigan, and most recently Harvard University in Boston. He is one of QuEra Computing's first employees and manages a 10+ team of theorists and computer scientists working in algorithms and applications.

Here we go for Shengtao's words of wisdom:

*SPTS:* When it comes to time allocation, what would you say are the main challenges and peculiarities of managing a scientific team?

*SW:* In a fast-paced environment where priorities are fluid, aligning a team's priorities and motivations becomes crucial. If you manage to do this effectively, even when delays occur in some projects, you will know that the team's strong motivation is focused on the highest priorities.

*SPTS:* How do you view motivation? What are the key factors that keep a scientific team motivated?

*SW:* To stay motivated, scientists truly need room for creativity and critical thinking. Discovery holds cultural importance for scientists. I believe it's crucial for team managers and leaders to secure and respect this space for creativity.

*SPTS:* What is the main “danger” or "tripping hazard" a scientific manager may face?

*SW:* When a scientific leader lacks a strong vision and a clear direction, the team risks becoming mediocre, and their output may be less impactful. On the other hand, team managers and leaders should avoid micromanaging how goals and visions are achieved. Instead, they should allow highly motivated individuals to find their own paths to success.

*SPTS:* How do you distinguish the above in an academic vs private environments?
{: .notice--warning}

*SW:* In my view, the industry setting requires considerably more management due to many more competing factors and priorities. Academic labs can thrive on self-organization and adapt naturally to changing research directions. In contrast, in industry settings, it is crucial for individual and team goals to align with the company’s vision and objectives. Consequently, more management and coordination both within and between teams are essential for overall success.

<p> 
    Welcome to my professional website and blog! <br> <br>

    I am a physicist, educator, and an architect and manager of R&D organizations. I am currently employed at <a href="https://www.quera.com">QuEra Computing</a>. On this page you can learn about my professional activities, academic and otherwise, as well as a bit about my personal interests which include Irish and Japanese oral traditions.  <br> <br>

    Also, don't miss the blogging section! </br> Browse it for news and discussions on physics, scientific management, entrepreneurship, and leadership. I may also not resist the eventual tidbit on sustainable lifestyles. <br><br>

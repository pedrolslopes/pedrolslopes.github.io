    excerpt: <ul>
                 <li> I have experience <b> leading all aspects </b> of scientific research, program management, and business development. </li>
                 <li> Currently I am the <b> tech advocate </b> of QuEra Computing, where I also manage strategic government and partner accounts. </li>
                 <li> I coordinate multi-party research teams at the boundary of academia and industry. </li>
                 <li> I <b>led the design</b> of the first industry-grade course on quantum computing with neutral atoms, with hundreds of trainees. </li>
                 <li> I <b>marketed and developed</b> the user base of the world's first publicly accessible neutral-atom quantum computer.</li>
                 <li> Previously, I <b> directed multi-faculty </b> teams in a major research program at the University of British Columbia. </li>
                 <li> My further professional interests include talent acquisition and retention, and how it impacts organizations.</li>

            <ul>
                 <li> I held <b>postodctoral fellowships</b> at the Institut Quantique (Qu√©bec) and Quantum Matter Institute (British Columbia). </li>
                 <li> I have <b> PhD </b> in Physics, obtained from the University of Campinas (Brazil) and UIUC (Illinois). </li>
                 <li> I obtained my <b>BSc</b> in Physics also in Campinas (Brazil), where I graduated at the top of my class. </li>
                 <li> My favorite scientific contributions are predicting material signatures of chiral anomaly phenomena (verified experimentally) and proposing a non-topological mechanism for anyonic qubits.</li>
                 <li> More recently, I am working on applications of quantum computing in simulations, optimization, and machine learning.</li>  
            </ul>

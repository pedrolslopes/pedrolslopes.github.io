    excerpt: 'This is a course introducing quantum computing with neutral atoms. Rather than focusing on the basics of quantum computing, a subject well covered in many places, this material targets expert-level thinking for programming many-body quantum systems. Practice and operation is done via the *Bloqade* platform, with materials covering both the [**Julia**](https://queracomputing.github.io/Bloqade.jl/stable/) and [**Python**](https://bloqade.quera.com/latest/) (in development) versions of the package.  An interactive self-study course, with quizzes, can be accessed in [**this qbook**](https://qbook.quera.com/) platform. The content is hosted on GitHub and was developed under my direction by me and colleagues from QuEra Computing.'

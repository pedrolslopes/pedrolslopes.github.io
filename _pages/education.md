    title: <a href="https://github.com/QuEraComputing/quera-education" style="color:#343434">Quantum Computing with Neutral Atoms</a><a href="https://github.com/QuEraComputing/quera-education" style="color:#000000"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>
    excerpt: 'This is a course introducing quantum computing with neutral atoms. Rather than focusing on the basics of quantum computing, a subject well covered in many places, this material targets expert-level thinking for programming many-body quantum systems. Practice and operation is done via the *Bloqade* platform, with materials covering both the [**Julia**](https://queracomputing.github.io/Bloqade.jl/stable/) and [**Python**](https://bloqade.quera.com/latest/) (in development) versions of the package. The content is hosted on GitHub and was developed under my direction by me and colleagues from QuEra Computing. *Stay tuned as a virtual book version of this is under development.*'
